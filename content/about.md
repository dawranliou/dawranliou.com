# About

I'm a [Taiwanese][Taiwan] software developer currently based in California, USA.
I enjoy playing tennis, drawing, reading books, and writing
software. Programming languages and software development tools are my favorite
topics to write on my [blog](/blog/), where you'll find lots of articles about
[Clojure][Clojure] and [Emacs][Emacs].  As I started learning more [Common
Lisp][Common Lisp], game development, and generative arts, I hope to share some
articles about those topics soon on this website.

The year 2022 marks my 9th year of being a professional software developer.
After graduating with a Mechanical Engineering Master's degree, I started my
career as a Java programmer writing the system software for the
optical-mechanical wafer inspection tools at [KLA][KLA], a well-known company in
the Semi-conductor Industry for creating high-end Process Management equipment.
At KLA, I learned a lot about Concurrency, Object-Oriented Programming,
Dependency Injection, the software development process, writing documentation,
etc.  It was an excellent job for a college new grad as I grew a lot as a junior
developer during my time there.  I also started getting quite involved in
software communities like Python and JavaScript outside of work to satisfy my
personal curiosity.  However, it became apparent that neither language was good
enough for me when I began to prefer the Functional Programming style more to
build software.  Then I found my current favorite language, Clojure.[^1]

After five and a half years, I left KLA and joined [Kira Systems][Kira Systems]
to work on Clojure and [ClojureScript][ClojureScript] full time.  (Finally, the
dream came true!)  At Kira, we've built a successful B2B SaaS product to solve
contract reviewing/analysis using Machine Learning for the Legal Tech Industry.
Though I don't work on our home-grown, hand-crafted, fine-tuned, artisan ML
engine written in [GO](Golang), I enjoyed working with the ML researchers and
learning the domain knowledge.  This is probably one of the best perks of being
a software developer - we get the opportunities to learn different domains and
industries.

Kira was then acquired by [Litera][Litera] in September 2021, marking an
impressive exit for a startup that betted itself on Clojure back in 2010.
Litera is a much bigger company than Kira, with several product offerings to the
legal professionals.  This is kind of a classic "small Clojure team in a big
org" situation.  It's nice to see Clojure continue to thrive as the Kira team
continue to offer the best contract analysis software in the legal tech
industry.

## How I work

Being genuinely curious about many things, I'm a pretty huge generalist in
software development.  Earlier in my career, I was mainly working on application
backends that deals with data storage and concurrencies.  Ever since I started
working for Kira, I have been heavily involved in developing application
front-end and worked closely with product designers to build accessible user
experiences.  Outside of work, as I started working on generative art and game
development, I now know more on Computer Graphics than ever in my life.

When it comes to my preference between green-field projects vs legacy projects,
I prefer legacy projects where I imagine myself being an archaeologist
recovering lost human records from ancient artifacts.  I enjoyed the process of
discovering and documenting things that people overlooked.  When I worked on
green-field projects, I prefer the old, proven, boring tools over the latest
over-hyped ones.

I'm very keen on my REPL-driven workflow while developing software.  There's
nothing more disruptive to my productivity than not having a live REPL where I
can reload code on-the-fly.  I also depend on using Emacs a lot doing other
development-related work - interfacing git, running shell commands, reading
logs, check remote files on server, manipulating text, writing notes, etc.

## What I'm doing now

* Software Developer at [Kira Systems][Kira Systems] building Clojure/Script
  full-stack web app
* Publishing articles on this website
* Tinkering [my Emacs configuration][Emacs configuration]
* Learning [Common Lisp][Common Lisp], game development, and computer graphics.

## Footnotes

[^1]: There is an interesting backstory to my LISP experiences: Clojure wasn't my first LISP language.  Back in 2008, when I was a sophomore, I was already writing [AutoLISP][AutoLisp] to generate CADs (Computer-Aided Design) for my Mechanical Design class.  Programming with AutoLISP wasn't like using a general-purpose programming language, but I still felt nostalgic when I picked up [Clojure][Clojure].
