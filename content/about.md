# About

I'm a software developer based in North America. I enjoy playing tennis, reading
books, and writing software.  [Clojure] is my favorite programming language, and
[Emacs] is my favorite development environment.  I write about them a lot here
on [my blog].

Entering my 8th year of being a professional software developer, I want to
reflect a bit about my journey so far.  I started my career as a Java programmer
writing the system software for the optical-mechanical wafer inspection stations
at KLA.  It was an excellent job for a college new grad like myself at the time.
At KLA, I learned a lot about Object-Oriented Programming, Dependency Injection,
the software development process, and writing documentation.  I also started
getting quite involved in other software communities outside of work as my
creative outlets.  First, it was Python then JavaScript, but when I began to
think more in the Functional-style Programming, it became apparent that Python
isn't for me.  And then I found my favorite language, [Clojure].

After five and a half years at KLA, I joined [Kira Systems] to work with
[Clojure] and [ClojureScript] full time.  Interestingly, my first Lisp
programming language was not [Clojure].  In 2008, I was already using [AutoLISP]
to generate CADs (Computer-Aided Design) for my Mechanical Design class.  It
wasn't quite like general-purpose programming, but I felt nostalgic for those
parentheses when I started learning [Clojure].

I've been a happy Clojurist for almost two years now, rocking my [Emacs] as my
day-to-day programming environment.  I have no intention to go back to do
full-time work using Java, JavaScript, or Python.

## What I'm doing now {#now}

* Software Developer at [Kira Systems] building Clojure/Script full-stack web
  app
* Publishing articles on this website
* Tinkering my [Emacs configuration]
* Exploring generative art. You can follow my progress [here][sketchbook].
* Reading [Project Hail Mary] by Andy Weir
