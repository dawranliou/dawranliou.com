# About

I'm a software developer based in North America. I enjoy playing tennis, reading
books, and writing software.  [Clojure] is my favorite programming language, and
[Emacs] is my favorite development environment.  I write about them a lot here
on [my blog].

This is my 8th year of being a professional software developer.  I started my
career as a Java programmer writing the system software for the
optical-mechanical wafer inspection tools at [KLA], a well-known company in the
Semi-conductor Industry for creating high-end Process Management equipment.  At
KLA, I learned a lot about Object-Oriented Programming, Dependency Injection,
the software development process, writing documentation, etc.  It was an
excellent job for a college new grad as I grew a lot as a developer.  I also
started getting quite involved in software communities outside of work.  First,
it was Python and JavaScript.  When I began to prefer Functional Programming
style more, it became apparent that neither languages are good enough for me.
Then I found my current favorite language, Clojure.[^1]

I left KLA after five and a half years, and joined [Kira Systems] to work on
Clojure and [ClojureScript] full time.  (Finally the dream came true!)  At Kira,
we've built a successful B2B SaaS product to solve contract reviewing/analysis
for the Legal Tech Industry using Machine Learning.  Though personally I don't
work on our home-grown, hand-crafted, fine-tuned, artisan ML engine, I really
enjoyed working with the ML researchers and learning the domain knowledge.  This
is probably one of the best perks of being a software developer - we get the
opportunities to learn different domains and different industries.

Kira was acquired by [Litera] in September, 2021. Litera a much bigger company
than Kira, with several products to offer to the legal world. It'll be
interesting to see how Clojure will thrive in this industry. And I'm excited for
what's coming next!

## What I'm doing now {#now}

* Software Developer at [Kira Systems] building Clojure/Script full-stack web
  app
* Publishing articles on this website
* Tinkering my [Emacs configuration]
* Exploring generative art. You can follow my progress [here][sketchbook].
* Reading [Project Hail Mary] by Andy Weir

## Footnotes

[^1]: There is an interesting backstory to my LISP experiences: Clojure wasn't
my first LISP language.  Back in 2008 when I was a sophomore, I was already
writing [AutoLISP] to generate CADs (Computer-Aided Design) for my Mechanical
Design class.  AutoLISP wasn't quite like general-purpose programming, but I
still felt nostalgic when I first started learning [Clojure].
