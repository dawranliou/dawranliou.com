# About

I'm a software developer based in California. I enjoy playing tennis, reading
books, and writing software.  [Clojure] is my favorite programming language, and
[Emacs] is my favorite development environment.  I write about them a lot here
on [my blog].

The year 2021 marks my 8th year of being a professional software developer.
After graduating with a Mechanical Engineering Master's degree, I started my
career as a Java programmer writing the system software for the
optical-mechanical wafer inspection tools at [KLA], a well-known company in the
Semi-conductor Industry for creating high-end Process Management equipment.  At
KLA, I learned a lot about Concurrency, Object-Oriented Programming, Dependency
Injection, the software development process, writing documentation, etc.  It was
an excellent job for a college new grad as I grew a lot as a junior developer
during my time there.  I also started getting quite involved in software
communities like Python and JavaScript outside of work.  However, it became
apparent that neither language was good enough for me when I began to prefer the
Functional Programming style more.  Then I found my current favorite language,
Clojure.[^1]

After five and a half years, I left KLA and joined [Kira Systems] to work on
Clojure and [ClojureScript] full time.  (Finally, the dream came true!)  At
Kira, we've built a successful B2B SaaS product to solve contract
reviewing/analysis using Machine Learning for the Legal Tech Industry.  Though I
don't work on our home-grown, hand-crafted, fine-tuned, artisan ML engine, I
enjoyed working with the ML researchers and learning the domain knowledge.  This
is probably one of the best perks of being a software developer - we get the
opportunities to learn different domains and industries.

Being generally curious about so many things, I'm more like a generalist than
specialist in software development (although I do significantly more work in the
backend earlier in my career.)  Ever since I started working for Kira, my focus
has shifted to the front-end.  Nowadays, I've become comfortable writing raw CSS
without any framework, I pay attention to accessibility, and I understand the
quirks of browser JavaScript and the ClojureScript compiler a lot more.

Kira was acquired by [Litera] in September 2021. Litera is a much bigger company
than Kira, with several products to offer to the legal world. It'll be
interesting to see how Clojure will thrive in this industry.  And I'm excited
about what's coming next!

## What I'm doing now {#now}

  app
* Publishing articles on this website
* Tinkering my [Emacs configuration]
* Exploring generative art. You can follow my progress [here][sketches].
* Reading [Project Hail Mary] by Andy Weir
* Learning [Common Lisp]

## Footnotes

[^1]: There is an interesting backstory to my LISP experiences: Clojure wasn't
    my first LISP language.  Back in 2008, when I was a sophomore, I was already
    writing [AutoLISP] to generate CADs (Computer-Aided Design) for my
    Mechanical Design class.  Programming with AutoLISP wasn't like using a
    general-purpose programming language, but I still felt nostalgic when I
    picked up [Clojure].
