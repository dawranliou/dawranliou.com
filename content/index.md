# Hi, my name is Daw-Ran Liou

You've found my personal website!  Thank you for visiting!

I'm a Taiwanese software developer currently based in California, USA.
I enjoy playing tennis, drawing, reading books, and writing
software. Programming languages and software development tools are my favorite
topics to write on my [blog](/blog/), where you'll find lots of articles about
[Clojure][Clojure] and [Emacs][Emacs].  As I started learning more [Common
Lisp][Common Lisp], game development, and generative arts, I hope to share some
articles about those topics soon on this website.

This site has [recently gone through a major rewrote][rewrote] with my low-tech
hand-crafted static site generator based on [Babashka][Babashka], the Clojure
variant great for shell scripting.  It's quite likely that I caused some
breakages with this change.  If you notice there's any broken link or wrong
formats, feel free to open an issue on my [issue tracker][issue tracker] or
[drop me a message](/contact).
