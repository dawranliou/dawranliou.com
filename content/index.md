# Hi, my name is Daw-Ran Liou

You've found my personal website!  Thank you for visiting!

I'm a software developer based in California.  I enjoy playing tennis, reading
books, and writing software.  [Clojure] is my favorite programming language, and
[Emacs] is my favorite development environment.  I like to write about
technologies like the programming languages and tools I enjoy using.
