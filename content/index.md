# Hi, my name is Daw-Ran Liou

You've found my personal website!  Thank you for visiting!

I'm a software developer based in California.  I enjoy playing tennis, reading
books, and writing software.  [Clojure][Clojure] is my favorite programming
language, and [Emacs][Emacs] is my favorite development environment.  I like to
write about technologies like the programming languages and tools I enjoy using.

This site has [recently gone through a major rewrote][rewrote] with my low-tech
hand-crafted static site generator based on [Babashka][Babashka], the Clojure
variant great for shell scripting.  It's quite likely that I caused some
breakages with this change.  If you notice there's any broken link or wrong
formats, feel free to open an issue on my [issue tracker][issue tracker] or
[drop me a message](/contact).
