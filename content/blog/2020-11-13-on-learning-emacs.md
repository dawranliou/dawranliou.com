_Classical learning curves for some common editors_

I once came across a Tweet telling people how to use Emacs like this: step 1,
download Emacs; step 2, spend the next 10 years configuring it. At first, this
seems pretty silly, yet, there are some truths in it. I, for one, didn't
spend 10 years before becoming comfortable using Emacs as my daily driving horse
in software development. However, I could very well imagine that after 10 years
I'd still be tinkering my Emacs config with a sense of satisfaction.

In retrospect, I found it amusing that both of my two favorite tools in software
development, i.e. Clojure and Emacs, don't seem to care much about the
friendliness for newcomers. Yes, the community is very welcoming. However, the
tools themselves are pretty demanding for the newcomers. Clojure required a huge
leap of faith to unlearn most of my previous OOP experiences, whereas Emacs
required me to design my own text editor from scratch and to have some
understanding of the ELisp programming language. Neither of them promise
newcomers to "hit the ground running" or "learn it over the weekend".

In my observation, the whole software industry puts too much spotlight on "the
latest and the greatest" things. FOMO, the fear of missing out, has fueled a
culture of desiring speed. The easiness of learning has become an advertising
term for many of the software tools such as libraries and languages. However,
__the effectiveness of a tool would eventually outweigh the difficulty to learn
it in the long run__. If I saved myself 15 minutes for using Emacs every day at
work, I already saved myself 65 hours last year. That is almost three extra days
an year. Even if I initially had spent a full week do nothing but learning
Emacs, I would still start seeing the payoffs in the third year, as well as the
rest of my life. The math isn't really important here. To be honest with you, I
don't think I merely saved 15 minutes a day for using Emacs. The important thing
is this - the ROI of learning a new tool is a long game. The longer you stick
with it, the less significant the initial investment is. What's more important
is the capability of the tool itself.

That brings me to the next key point: __Emacs isn't just a text editor.__ Some
people think Emacs as their operating system. I like to think __Emacs as an
integrated development environment__. Modern software development usually
involves multiple tools: text editor, compiler, interpreter, repl, test runner,
version control system, database client, or the browser. Every project is
different and there is no one single IDE will meet all needs. We reach different
tools for different purposes and inevitably are forced to make context
switches. Context switches break our development flow. It's draining for me to
constantly reaching for a different tool with different key bindings or requires
me to use the mouse. I really would prefer to stay inside one tool with the same
universal key bindings all the time.

When I started off learning Emacs, I tried to find the best and most
conventional way to set it up. I was also feeling wrong for using the Vim key
bindings rather than the default Emacs key bindings. This idea seems silly to me
now for __there should be no one true way of using Emacs__. Every one is using
Emacs differently, with different background, under different context. I use a
different keyboard than most people I know. I have a
[Planck](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck) keyboard that only has 50 keys. A
lot of the special characters I cannot type without a modifier key already. I
couldn't afford to hit a key chord that requires hitting multiple modifier keys
plus a special character. Something like `C-M-$` would be pretty humanly
impossible to press with one hand. I'm glad Emacs is flexible enough to fit my
needs.

To recap, here's my key points:
1. The effectiveness of a tool would eventually outweigh the difficulty to
learn it in the long run.
1. Emacs is an integrated development environment rather than a text editor.
1. There's no one true way of using Emacs.
