_I've been wanting to write articles about generators for quite some time.
Generator is definitely one of my favorite features in Python. Ever since I stopped treating
Python like other programming languages, e.g. Java or C++,
I start having so much fun writing codes.
Unlike other very powerful features (decorators,
context managers, or classes) that I sometimes abused a lot, Generators don't
ever seemed to be too much in my code. They have strong purpose in the code, and are very
beautiful in the codes. In this article, I'll explain the basics things about generators.
At the end, I'll show you how to use it to solve some problems._

# 1. Why do I need to know generators?

There're two categories of use cases:

1. To generate a series of data
1. To pause code execution

For category #1, you might think _"why we need another tool while we already
know how to write lists to store a series of data?"_ There are three reasons:
1) list can't solve all problems, 2) performance, and 3) code style.

1. List can't solve all problems. In the cases that we have a infinite
series of data (e.g. generating prime numbers,) or the series of data
that we can't tell when it'll stop (e.g. parsing log files that still are adding more
entries,) there's no easy way to extract this part of code into
a function that returns a list. On the other hand, generators are perfectly fine
for these jobs.
1. Performance. Space-wise, if the data series consumer just need one data point
at a time, why waste the memory to hold the entire copy of the data series? Time-wise,
if the data consumer does not require all the data to be present to do the next
thing, why waste time to wait till all data are at hand while you can pass on the
data to do work at the same time? Generators are good for both cases.
1. Code style. This is a bit opinionative. I feel coding with generators is usually cleaner and
easier to understand then functions without them. Also opinionative, usually a generator code is
a hint of outputting a series of data. Therefore, I have some idea of what the
code is doing even without looking at the code line-by-line.

For category #2, this is something very powerful. Normal functions, or
called subroutines, execute line by line till they `return` control to
the caller. Generators, or a coroutine, execute till they `yield` a value
to the caller and pause the current state until their caller invoke them
again to resume the execution. My favorite examples for this case is the
`@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator in [20 Python libraries you aren't using (but should)](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/20-python-libraries-you-arent-using-but-should#contextlib-ZKsPtpTX)
and also David Beazley's incredible live demo in PyCon 2015 -[Python Concurrency From the Ground Up: LIVE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4).

# 2. What are generators?

Python's generator is a special case of [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).
If looking at the proper definition gives you an headache, my way of understanding
it is - _generators are functions that don't return_. I admit there are many
flaws in my definition, but this definition helps me to understand some key
concepts. Ask yourself a question, _what does `return` mean?_

`return` means to return control to the caller. Python virtual machine is a
stack machine. When a function is called, a frame object is PUSH onto the
execution stack. This frame object is a mini environment for the function.
Having this enclosing mini environment, the function could have its own
variables without worrying about variable names colliding with the outer
environment. When the function returns, the frame object is POPPED from the
stack. All the variables sitting inside the mini environment are gone. The
caller regains full control and continues.

Generators, however, do not return full control to the caller. Instead, they
pause (or yield.) Thus, the mini environment of the generators, are still
sitting somewhere in the memory, waiting to be invoked.

Before I bored you to death with all the descriptions, let's see some code
example.

Just like functions are objects in Python, generators are also objects.
They are special objects that looks very similar to regular function
definitions but behaves very differently:

```python
def a_function():
    return True

def a_generator():
    yield True

>>> a_function()
True

>>> a_generator()
<generator object a_generator at 0x...>
```

When generator objects are created, they don't start executing immediately.
Generator objects, like `a_generator()`, follow the Iterator Protocol. So
to invoke them, you can use the builtin function `next()`

```python
>>> g = a_generator()
>>> next(g)
True
>>> next(g)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```

Not only do generators are iterators, they are also iterables!
(You can know more about the distinction between iterables and iterators from
[Ned Batchelder - Loop like a native: while, for, iterators, generators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnSu9hHGq5o).)
The builtin `iter` function call simply returns the generator itself,
which is a iterator:

```python
>>> iter(g) is g
True
```

Thus, all the builtin functions and external APIs that takes iterables
as input, works for generators! _(This is one of the most exciting realization
I had while learning Python.)_ Keep this in mind. We're
counting on it for the next section.

# 3. How do I use generators?

Recall that I said generators are good to generate a series of data. Thus,
using generators with loops is a good idea:

```python
def best_burger_generator():
    yield 'bun'
    yield 'veggies'
    for i in range(2):
        yield 'patty'
        yield 'cheese'
    yield 'sause'
    yield 'onion'
    yield 'bun'

>>> doubledouble_recipe = best_burger_generator()
>>> list(doubledouble_recipe)
['bun', 'veggies', 'patty', 'cheese', 'patty', 'cheese', 'sause', 'onion', 'bun']
```

Or to generate an infinite series of data:

```python
def perfect_24_7_drive_thru():
    while True:
        yield 'doubledouble and animal fries'

>>> drive_thru = perfect_24_7_drive_thru()
>>> next(drive_thru)
'doubledouble and animal fries'
>>> next(drive_thru)
'doubledouble and animal fries'
>>> # forever and ever satisfaction
```

Recall what I said, generators are iterables. Thus, be confident to iterate through
them or plug them into functions that takes iterables:

```python
# loop through the generator with a for-loop
>>> for ingredient in best_burger_generator():
...     print(ingredient)
...
bun
veggies
patty
# rests

# use API that take an iterable
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> ingredients = Counter(best_burger_generator())
>>> ingredients
Counter({'bun': 2, 'patty': 2, 'cheese': 2, 'veggies': 1, 'sause': 1, 'onion': 1})
```

# 4. Generator in action

To demonstrate some examples using generators, I'm going to show you
how to solve problems without them, and then with them, so we could
compare the different flavors.

### Fibonacci number series

Assuming we have a function to calculate the incredible series of data - the first n
fibonacci numbers. This is the recursive solution most of us learned (with caching to
get some performance):

```python
# Recursive solution to get the first 10 fibonacci numbers
import functools

@functools.lru_cache()
def fibonacci(nth):
    "Calculate the nth fibonacci number."
    if nth < 2:
        return 1
    return fibonacci(nth-2) + fibonacci(nth-1)

def fibonacci_series(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(fibonacci(i))
    return result

>>> fibonacci_series(10)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
```

And here's an iterative solution with generator:

```python
# Iterative solution to get the first 10 fibonacci numbers using generator
def fibonacci_generator(nth):
    "Yield the first nth fibonacci number."
    n, m = 0, 1
    for _ in range(nth):
        yield m
        n, m = m, n+m

>>> f = fibonacci_generator(10)
>>> list(f)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
```

I love recursion. I think they are elegant and beautiful. However, I do find
the generator version of the solution much easier for my brain. If you only
compare the `fibonacci` function and the `fibonacci_generator` function, the
difference may not be significant, and the coding style really depends on
personal preferences. So I say it's a draw. Let's look at other examples.

### Sliding window

Given a sequence and the window size, an example of sliding window function's
input-output pair is:
> ```'ABCDEF', size=2 -> 'AB', 'BC', 'CD', 'DE', 'EF'```

A naive iterative solution is:

```python
def sliding_window(sequence, size):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(sequence)-size+1):
        result.append(sequence[i:i+size])
    return result

>>> sliding_window('ABCDEF', 2)
['AB', 'BC', 'CD', 'DE', 'EF']
```

A generator approach is:

```python
def sliding_window(sequence, size):
    for i in range(len(sequence)-size+1):
        yield sequence[i:i+size]

>>> list(sliding_window('ABCDEF', 2))
['AB', 'BC', 'CD', 'DE', 'EF']
```

This example I think the generator approach is significantly better
than the other. First off, the code is much cleaner.
Second, the purpose of the sliding window function is to be consumed
by another function, one-at-a-time. Why keep duplicates hanging around in memory?

Say, you have a large data set for a machine learning model.
The sliding window is used to segment the data for training and
cross validation. Data `A` for training while `B` for cross validation; then,
`B` for training, `C` for cross validation. In this case, you really don't need all the
other data while working on the current one.

# 5. Conclusion

Being fluent in using generators is one of the things that took
my Python to the next level. They are expressive, cleaner, and for
most of the time, more efficient.

# 6. Action

Next time when you're writing some Python code, if there's a function
that need to return a sequence of data, think if it make sense to refactor
it as a generator function.

And for your own study, take a look at the Python official document page
[10.1 itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html). There
are lots of examples of using the `yield` expression.
