Besides all the other amazing things Clojure enables, I just want to take a
moment to appreciate Clojure being a functional programming language that offers
many higher-order functions out of the box great for daily tasks. Although the
usage of higher-order functions could sometimes lead to too much cleverness in
the code, and arguably bad for readability (apologies to my colleagues), it's
really fun to express code without creating any one-off anonymous function
explicitly.

This post is the index to all the articles in the series and the future articles
in the planning.
