I came across [the interview with Henrik Lissner], the creator of Doom Emacs,
and it really resonated with me about the biggest positive for Emacs (starting
at [48:37]):

Living inside the REPL (or working inside a running program) is such a powerful
technique in programming. That's also one of the reasons drove me towards Emacs
after learning Clojure, even though the two LISPs have very different ideals or
philosophies.
