# Blog

I like writing things down into articles, whether personal research articles,
technologies, or just some brain dumps.  As a result, the qualities from article
to article vary quite a bit.  While there are some subtle trends to my writings
if viewed in chronological order, like most blogs, I'd instead recommend you to
start with my favorite articles:

- [Defaulting to Transducers][7]
- [Vanilla ClojureScript][6]
- [Better performance with Java arrays in Clojure][1]
- [Clojure higher-order functions explained: fnil][2]
- [Clojure nil busting one-liners][3]
- [Compiling Emacs from Source on MacOS Big Sur](/blog/compiling-emacs-from-source)
- [Structural editing in vanilla Emacs](/blog/structural-editing-in-vanilla-emacs)
- [Rethink Syntax Highlighting][4]
- [On Personal Websites][5]
