From the [Spring Lisp Game Jam 2021][3] site:

> Lisp Game Jam is a bi-annual game jam taking place for a full 10 days. After
> the jam has finished, 3 days are given to everyone to try out the game
> submissions and vote for their favorites.

My goal coming into this Game Jam was to finish a playable game. No matter how
burnout I felt at the end, I was quite happy to finish the game using just my
own free time. The game is quite enjoyable and fun (to me) in many aspects. I
submitted my game after 8 days of jamming. You can play my game, Spirited, [here
on my itch.io page][2], or in the iframe below. If you just want to see the
source code, it's GPL-licensed on my [Github][1].

The game was written in [Fennel][4] on [TIC-80][5].

Some lessons were learned:

1. My Clojure experiences didn't really matter.
1. Making the tile set is a skill worth learning.
1. Lua's Coroutines is a great tool for game programming that I need to learn
   more for my next game jam.

Some unexpected were found:

1. I had a lot more fun than I expected making the game's soundtrack and SFX.
1. I enjoyed a lot doing world building, story telling, and designing dialogues.
1. There are a lot more stories I want to tell in the world of Spirited.
