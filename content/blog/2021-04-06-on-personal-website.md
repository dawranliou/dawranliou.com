Hi everyone! I want to share some of my thoughts and the benefits of building
personal websites. This won't be a step-by-step guide to building your first
personal website. It'll take me to write another article for it. Instead,
hopefully, I can convince you to build a personal website. Here we go.

# Learning the technologies

Building a personal website is a great learning exercise for the underlying
technologies because of **the variability of complexity** and its
**visibility**. People with different experiences may want to deal with
different complexities. If you are a technology-savvy person, you can build your
website with a state-of-the-art JS framework with whatever latest graph API
backend, styled with CSS-in-JS (I'm just throwing a lot of random buzz words
here, please don't take me too seriously 😛). If you are a minimalist, you can
build a static website with hand-crafted HTML and CSS. You can even use a site
builder like Wix to learn the basics of styling and focus on personal branding
only. You have a wide range of choices, and they don't usually affect the end
product - a website that is visible to the whole internet. You can share it with
anyone, anywhere. The visibility makes it so rewarding.

# Personal branding

IMHO, managing one's online presence is very important, if not crucial,
nowadays. A quick test for your online presence is to search your name on the
search engine. What does the first page of the search results say about you? Do
you have a say about the search results? I.e., do you have a way to influence
the websites/articles that other people see you online? IMO social media profile
isn't the answer. There is so much more to a person's characters than the news
or photos or random rantings they share online. It's a lot easier for a unique
website to stand out in the crowd of the always same-looking social media
profiles.

(I'm a bit biased here because I don't trust social media, and you probably
shouldn't either 😉.)

# Self-publishing articles

Writing is such a crucial skill to have regardless of your level of experience
or your position. I cannot express enough how much my writing skills benefited
from publishing articles on my personal blog. When you have your own website,
you turn yourself into a publisher as well as an author. Consider this, how hard
is it to publish an essay in a renowned science journal? You are practically
free to write and publish articles on your website. Of course, the stakes
between publishing on a journal are significantly different from publishing on
your website. And that's exactly why writing for your own website is such a good
practice ground to develop your writing skills.

# Bonus: your website, your values

This may not be very important to most of us, but don't let the platforms'
values define you. For example:

* If you are pro-privacy, you don't need to track your readers using Google
  analytics on your websites.
* If you hate ads, you don't have to show ads on your websites.
* If you hate JavaScript, you don't have to use JavaScript to build your
  websites.

# Conclusion

Yes, you need a personal website.
