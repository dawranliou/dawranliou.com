title: Re-frame Effects VS Coeffects
tags: [clojure]
---

When I first started using `re-frame`, I was a bit confused about what
effects and coeffects are, or, what `fx`s and `cofx`s are.
They both seemed to relate to the “Side Effects” (or “Effects”) functional
programmers dislike. It was hard for me to distinguish them.

Before you read on, if you've never came across re-frame's
[official documentation](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/docs/README.md)
or the [cljdoc page](https://cljdoc.org/d/re-frame/re-frame/0.10.8/doc/introduction),
please start there. They are fantastic resources. However, if you find yourself
need some more examples or direct comparisons to help you understand them, please
read on.

## Two types of side effects

![side effects everywhere meme](side-effects-everywhere.jpg)

Out of the box, `re-frame` comes with the mechanisms to update the
application state. When your application needs to cause a side effect
on the application state, you only need to write `reg-event-db`,
to register your event handlers. The side effects that operate
on the application state is well-managed. There’s very little
confusion about them, so this article will not focus on those side effects.

The two types of side effects we are focusing on are the `effects`
and the `coeffects`, or `fx`s and the `cofx`s. These two types
represent things that are not a part of the application state,
such as:

1. Database
1. LocalStore
1. Third-Party APIs
1. (Other external resources that are not deterministic)

The differences are:

* `fx`s are ***pushed*** by an event, whereas,
* `cofx`s are ***pulled*** by an event.

## Examples of `fx`

1. Push data to a database
1. Push data to localStore/cookie
1. Push data to a third party service
1. Push message to `js/alert`
1. Push a function to JavaScript event queue,
e.g. `js/setInterval`, `js/setTimeout`, `js/Promise`

## Example of `cofx`

1. Pull data from a database
1. Pull data from localStore/cookie
1. Pull data from a third party service
1. Pull current datetime from browser
1. Pull a random number

## What about `js/Promise`s that fetch data?

This situation is a bit mind-boggling at first. A more concrete
example is when doing interop with a JavaScript library in an event handler
to fetch data, and it returns a promise immediately.
Thinking sequentially, what I wanted is to wait until the data fetched,
then run the event handler. However, promises don’t work that way.

The solution is to think of this as a push side effect, or `fx`.
For example:

```
dispatch [:fetch-data] -> do-fx [:promise-fetch-data] -> dispatch [:data-fetched %]
```

This ends up with two event handlers, one effect handler, and no coeffect handler.
I doubt this is the best way because I wish I can just have one `:fetch-data`
coeffect handler.

## Summary

1. Effects push,
1. Coeffects pull,
1. (Please let me know if you have a better way to handle javascript promises.)
