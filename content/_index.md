# Hi, my name is Daw-Ran,

I'm a mid-level software developer based in the UTC-7 timezone, and I love
writing software! [Clojure] is my favorite programming language, and [Emacs] is
my favorite development environment. That's why I write about them a lot here on
[my blog].

I have done works in Java, Python, and JavaScript in the past. However, I am no
longer interested in working with these languages full-time.

When I'm away from my keyboard, I love playing tennis, coffee brewing, and
reading books.

## What I'm doing now {#now}

* Software Developer at [Kira Systems] building Clojure/Script full-stack web
  app
* Publishing articles on this website
* Tinkering my [Emacs configuration]
* Learning [pixelart typography][10]
* Reading [Project Hail Mary] by Andy Weir

## Current favorites {#favorites}

* Programming language: Clojure/Script
* Development environment: Emacs
* Books: Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson
* Sports: tennis
