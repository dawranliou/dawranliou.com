# Hi, my name is Daw-Ran Liou

You've found my personal website!  Thank you for visiting!

I'm a software developer based in North America.  I enjoy playing tennis,
reading books, and writing software.  [Clojure] is my favorite programming
language, and [Emacs] is my favorite development environment.  I like to write
about topics like the programming languages and tools I enjoy using.
